# Twitter Robot - Journalism Job Board Web scraper

This web scraper scrapes job boards (currently scrapes NYT, WAPO, and NPR) every morning. The data can be found [here](https://github.com/ndmvisuals/job-search-tool/tree/main/data).

Every morning the [twitter account](https://twitter.com/JobJournalism) will post how many jobs the company posted on their website from the previous day, and then post a description and link to the jobs in a tweet thread. If its useful feel free to give it a follow! If anyone has any suggestions on other companies to add let me know!
